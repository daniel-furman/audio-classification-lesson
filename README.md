A 15 minute mini-lesson on audio classification with deep learning, originating from the [2021 DAT/Artathon](https://datartathon.com). I am primarily self-taught in this area, and I first got into audio modeling during the BirdCLEF21 Kaggle competition (birdcall Sound Event Detection for natural soundscapes).  

* Introduction to audio classification (10 min).
* Colab notebook demo (5 min). 
  * ESC-50 classification of environmental audio recordings.
